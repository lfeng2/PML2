# Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

# Data 

The training data for this project are available here: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment. 

Download data as training and testing and read in data (converting '#DIV/0!' to NA).

```{r}
download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv", "training.csv")
download.file("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", "testing.csv")
training <- read.csv("training.csv", na.strings=c("#DIV/0!", ""))
testing <- read.csv("testing.csv", na.strings=c("#DIV/0!", ""))
summary(training$classe)
```

## Cleaning data:

### Remove columns with arbitrary 50% of missing values

```{r}
# Sum NAs per column
missingvalues <- apply(training, 2, function(x) { sum(is.na(x)) })

# set threshhold to remove columns with more than 50% of NAs
threshold <- nrow(training) * 0.5
training <- training[, which(missingvalues < threshold)]
ncol(training)
testing <- testing[, which(missingvalues < threshold)]
ncol(testing)
```

### Check and remove predictors with zero variance

```{r results = 'hide'}
nzv <- nearZeroVar(training)
nzv
sapply(nzv, function(x) summary(training[x]))

# Remove predictors with zero variance in both the train and the test sets
training <- training[,-nzv]
testing <- testing[,-nzv]
```

### Drop other columns that are not relavant to predictors
```{r}
dropColumns <- grep("timestamp|user_name|new_window|num_window|X", names(training))
training <- training[, -dropColumns]
testing <- testing[, -dropColumns]
```

## Cross Validation

Cross validation was achieved by splitting the training data into a test set and a training set using the following:

```{r}
# Set the seed to make the model reproducible
inTrain = createDataPartition(training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
# 60% of the original training data will be used to train the model
train <- training[inTrain,]
# The remaining 40% will be used to test the model
test <- training[-inTrain,]
```

The data was partioned by the `classe` variable to ensure the training set and test set contain examples of each class. 60% of the training data was allocated to the training set and the remainder for the validation set.

## Prediction

The random forest model used to prediction.

```{r}
registerDoParallel()
x <- train[-ncol(train)]
y <- train$classe

rf <- foreach(ntree=rep(150, 6), .combine=randomForest::combine, .packages='randomForest') %dopar% {
randomForest(x, y, ntree=ntree) 
}
```

## Error reports for both training and test data

```{r results = 'hide'}
predictions1 <- predict(rf, newdata=train)
```
```{r}
confusionMatrix(predictions1,train$classe)
```
```{r results = 'hide'}
predictions2 <- predict(rf, newdata=test)
```
```{r}
confusionMatrix(predictions2,test$classe)
```

## Conclusion
The random forest algorithm seems to perform well for predicting activities from accelerometers measurements.
